# Asteroids_Game
 I'm going to build a simple video game, based on the classic Asteroids.
# Learning Goals
 The learning goals of this project are:

 1. Introduce me to multi-file Python projects
 2. Show me a real-world use case for object-oriented programming
 3. To have a ton of fun building a rewarding project!

 My goal is not to learn game development.
